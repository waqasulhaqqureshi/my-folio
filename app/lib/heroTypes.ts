/*
 * Shared hero content shape.
 *
 * Kept separate from heroContent.ts because that module is `server-only` (it
 * touches fs). Client components need the TYPE but must never pull in the
 * module — so the contract lives here, where both sides can import it.
 */

/*
 * The hero portrait is LOCKED to the bundled asset and is deliberately NOT part
 * of HeroContent.
 *
 * Making it a constant rather than a validated-but-overridable field is what
 * makes the lock real: there is no field to persist, so a stale data file, a
 * hand-edited JSON, a replayed upload request or a crafted PUT body has nothing
 * to override. The type system then finds every read site for free.
 *
 * The two widths come from one master; the ratio is exported so the layout box
 * can be reserved before the bitmap decodes.
